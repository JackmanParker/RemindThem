# Overview

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}
This app currently stores meeting plans how long each should be and what members are going to be present, currently, this is just a proof of concept of being able to navigate windows and pull data and styling. This will eventually have ways to store contact information and schedule texts to be sent.  

# Development Environment
The development envoroment is Xcode, using swift specifically the SwiftUI library. Xcode also comes with a full fledged mobile simulator that can be used for testing.

# Future Work

* I am currently working on getting the app to access the messages app and have access to the contacts on the phone. 
* The app currently is mostly UI, but It will soon have ways to add meetings from the app itself.
* Flesh out navigation significantly more, so I can jump horizontally not just vertically through meetings, by swiping through meetings.
